This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to analyse and visualize retail pricing data, exploring potential insights and patterns within the dataset. The primary dataset, sourced from '/content/retail_price.csv,' is subjected to a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and characteristics.

The project employs popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Special attention is given to the distribution of key variables, correlation analysis, and the transformation of target variables, such as 'total_price,' using logarithmic scaling.

Additionally, the project includes the implementation of a decision tree regression model to predict 'total_price' based on selected features. Various regression metrics, including mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared score, are computed and analysed to assess the model's performance.

Furthermore, these tools help to understand the impact of different features on the model's predictions, providing insights into the driving factors behind pricing decisions.

Beyond traditional regression modelling, the project incorporates linear regression to analyse the relationship between product attributes and total price. The project also delves into the potential correlation between customer-related metrics and total price.

Lastly, the project extends its analysis to examine the impact of competitors on pricing, both in terms of unit price and shipping costs. The correlation of various features with unit price is visualized, providing a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing retail pricing.

In conclusion, this project offers a holistic approach to understanding and modelling retail pricing dynamics using machine learning, providing valuable insights for retailers and researchers in the field. The combination of exploratory data analysis, regression modelling, and interpretability tools contributes to a robust analysis of the dataset, paving the way for informed decision-making in the retail industry.
